As a traditional pen and paper style TTRPG, Pathfinder 2e has an enormous catalogue of rules that must either be memorized or readily available to play the game. This quick reference is an attempt by me to streamline the rules lookup process to allow a Game Master to run the table as smoothly as possible without the need for encyclopedic game knowledge or breaks in the action while they look up rules. </p>
